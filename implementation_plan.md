   - Consistent environment across all development machines
   - CI/CD pipelines use the same Docker configuration

2. **Local Development Option:**
   - Python virtual environment for lightweight development
   - Documented requirements for local system dependencies

Detailed setup instructions are provided in [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Verification Methods

### Test Organization

Tests are organized following pytest's recommended structure:

```

### Testing Workflow

For each phase of implementation:

1. Write tests first (test-driven development)
2. Implement the feature
3. Verify tests pass in the Docker environment
4. Run performance benchmarks where applicable

All tests can be run with a single command in the Docker environment:
```
docker-compose exec app pytest
```

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to developing the Voice Note Taking RAG system. The reorganized phased approach focuses first on chunking capabilities, followed by database integration, hybrid search, and response generation, before adding audio transcription capabilities. This allows for earlier testing of core RAG functionality using existing transcripts. Each phase has clear, verifiable exit criteria to ensure quality at every step. By following this plan, we'll build a robust, high-quality system that meets the requirements while incorporating best practices for RAG systems.
