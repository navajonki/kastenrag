# Implementation Plan for KastenRAG

This document outlines the implementation plan for the KastenRAG (Kasten Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system. The system is designed to process voice recordings (transcribed to text) and enable efficient retrieval of information through a question-answering interface.

  - [x] Update AtomicChunker to use template registry
  - [x] Create sample templates for different content types
  - [x] Add template testing script for experimentation
  - [x] Develop web UI for template management and comparison
  - [x] Implement template editing with proper separation of built-in vs custom templates
  - [x] Create side-by-side comparison of template combinations with detailed results
- [x] Real LLM verification
  - [x] Successfully generate chunks with OpenAI or Replicate models
  - [x] Verify chunks meet quality requirements from PRD
  - [x] Confirm logging and performance metrics work with real LLMs
