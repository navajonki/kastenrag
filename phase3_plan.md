# Phase 3: Vector Database Integration

This document outlines the implementation plan for Phase 3 of the KastenRAG project, focusing on vector database integration.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning Phase 3, we must first complete the remaining work for Phase 2:
- Successfully test the atomic chunking system with real LLM providers (OpenAI/Replicate)
- Verify that chunks meet the quality requirements specified in the PRD
- Validate that logging and performance metrics work correctly with real LLMs

## Overview

Phase 3 involves implementing vector embeddings for the atomic chunks generated in Phase 2 and storing them in a vector database (ChromaDB) for efficient similarity-based retrieval. This phase is crucial for enabling semantic search capabilities beyond simple keyword matching.

## Timeline

Estimated completion time: 2-3 weeks

  - Filtering based on metadata (topics, entities, etc.)
  - Result ranking and scoring
  - Hybrid search options (combining vector and keyword search)
- **Implementation Notes**:

4. Update pipeline orchestration for vector operations
5. Integrate with existing atomic chunking
6. Create end-to-end tests for the full pipeline
7. Benchmark performance and optimize as needed
8. Update documentation with vector operations

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Cover individual components (embedding generation, vector storage, search)
2. **Integration Tests**: Verify interactions between components
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test the full pipeline from text input to vector retrieval
4. **Performance Tests**: Benchmark with varying data sizes and query complexities

## Dependencies

- ChromaDB Python client
- OpenAI API (for embeddings)
- SentenceTransformers (alternative embedding model)
- NumPy/SciPy (for vector operations)

## Evaluation Metrics

1. **Search Relevance**: Precision, recall, and mean reciprocal rank
2. **Performance**: Embedding generation speed, storage efficiency, query latency
3. **Scalability**: Behavior with increasing dataset size

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Risk**: API rate limits for embedding generation
   **Mitigation**: Implement batch processing, caching, and rate limiting

2. **Risk**: Vector database performance issues with large datasets
   **Mitigation**: Use efficient indexing, consider sharding for large collections

3. **Risk**: Memory constraints with high-dimensional vectors
   **Mitigation**: Implement dimensionality reduction options, use efficient storage formats

## Next Steps After Completion

After successful implementation of Phase 3, the system will proceed to Phase 4 (Graph Database Integration) to represent relationships between entities extracted from the atomic chunks.
